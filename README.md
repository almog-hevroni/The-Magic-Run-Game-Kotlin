### Key Components
1. **Game Logic**
   - `GameBoard`: Manages the game grid and obstacle placement
   - `PlayerManager`: Handles player movement and position
   - `ObstacleManager`: Controls obstacle generation and movement
   - `GameTimer`: Manages game speed and updates
   - `GameManager`: Controls core game mechanics including:
     - Life management
     - Score tracking
     - Collision detection
     - Sound effects
     - Vibration feedback
     - Game over conditions

2. **UI Components**
   - Custom layouts for game board
   - Material Design components
   - Dynamic score display
   - Life indicator system

3. **Data Management**
   - SharedPreferences for score storage
   - Location tracking for score mapping
   - High score leaderboard system

## First Launch

When you first launch the application, you'll be prompted to grant location permissions. This is necessary for:
- Recording the location of your high scores
- Displaying scores on the interactive map
- Enhanced leaderboard functionality

You can choose to:
- Allow location access for full game features
- Deny location access (some features will be limited)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Add your Google Maps API key in the AndroidManifest.xml:
   ```xml
   <meta-data
       android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
       android:value="YOUR_API_KEY"/>
   ```
4. Build and run the project

## Permissions Required
- `VIBRATE`: For haptic feedback
- `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`: For score location tracking
- `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`: For approximate location data

## Game Controls

### Button Mode
- Tap left button to move left
- Tap right button to move right

### Sensor Mode
- Tilt device left to move left
